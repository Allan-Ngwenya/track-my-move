## Description

This is a MERN stack with graphql application which allows users to keep track of their property purchase and understand the different stages using a roadmap. Each stage has some information about what to expect and a checklist of items which need to be complete. The user also has the option to add comments for reminders and upload any files they wish to keep in one place. There is also an Estate Agent profile who can login and view all the different buyer's roadmaps and add comments to serve as an update for the buyer. In addition the buyer can set up a profile with a photo etc.
